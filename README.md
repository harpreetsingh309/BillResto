# BillResto

You are running a simple restaurant. Three groups come in Group 1: 3 people Group 2: 5 people Group 3: 7 people

They order a couple of things, and at the end when they come to pay,

Group1 opts to split the bill as per the individuals
Group2 gets a 10% discount and then one person pays the entire bill by credit card
Group3 starts with a $50 Tab and then settle the bill with a split payment, but you offer them a $25 discount and they all pay the split equally
